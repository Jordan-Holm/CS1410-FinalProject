CHANGE YOUR NAME TO MINE
  
  I'll be working on a casino game with Porter Jordan.
In our game you'll create a player with a base of $100
to start out. From there you'll be directed to a menu 
where you can choose which game you'd like to play.
There will be Blackjack, a slot machine, and a simple
coin flip game. If required or we're able to, we can 
add even more games. At the start of each game you'll
make a bet and depending on the outcome the player's
money will be adjusted accordingly
